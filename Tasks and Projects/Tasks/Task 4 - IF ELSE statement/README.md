Editor: Shunzhe Ma

You learned how to use IF-ELSE statement to determine whether a condition is met or not. And you should already know you could add codes that will be executed if the conditions are met. So now, you need to write codes about IF-ELSE statement by yourself to determine if 6 is larger than 3 or not.

```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
      int num1 = 3;
      int num2 = 6;
      //Replace your own code here
      //Print (System.out.print) "num 1 is larger" or "num 2 is larger"
}
```
