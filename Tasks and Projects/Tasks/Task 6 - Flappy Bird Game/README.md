##Assignment No. 03
Editor: Shunzhe Ma

This time, you'll learn to write codes in Java that can print out stars. In the example showed in classes, we write the following codes: 
```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
for (int n = 1; n <= i; ++n) {
System.out.print('*');
}
System.out.println();
}
}
```

And the result will be:

```
*
**
***
****
****
```

### This time, you are going to change the code above and make the output like this:

```
****
***
**
*
```
